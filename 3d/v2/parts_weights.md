To calculate the balance of the ball, here is the list of part weights measured with actual parts.

# Weight Measurement Methodology

Randomly pick 10 pieces of an item from a bag and measure with a calibrated precision scale. Divide the measured weight by 10. Repeat the procedure with the remaining parts 5–15 times depending on the total quantity, then remove the minimum and maximum values and take the median of the rest. Use 3 significant figures.

__Weight scale__: Vibra DJ-150 (Minimum unit: 0.01g, calibrated with calibration weights)
